Mini project:
-Use the auto MPG data set mpg.csv
-Set the feature “mpg” as our target (set “Good” and “Okay” as one class, and “Bad” as another class)
-Convert categorical feature “maker” into multiple dummy variables
-What are the top 3 most informative features? What is the maximum information gain and the corresponding threshold for each top 3 features?
-Build a decision tree model on this data set
-Make predictions with your tree model over the same data set. What is the highest accuracy you can get?
-Visualize your decision tree with functions from the lab session
